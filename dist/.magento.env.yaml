# error — runtime errors that don’t require immediate action but should be logged and monitored.                      #
# critical — critical conditions. For example, an unavailable application component, unexpected exceptions.           #
# alert — action must be taken immediately. For example, your website is down, the database is unavailable, etc.      #
#         This should trigger SMS alerts and wake you up.                                                             #
